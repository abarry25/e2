## Game planning

Pass the Pigs!

Items:
2 pigs

Objective:
Be the first player to score 100 points by rolling 2 pigs as if they were dice.

Instructions:
Points are scored based on how the pigs land
On player 1's turn
Player 1 rolls 2 pigs
Player 1 accumlates total of that roll
(for player input) Player 1 can stop rolling at any time
Player 1 must stop rolling when they Pig Out or reach 100 pts

Turn goes to player 2
On player 2's turn
Player 2 rolls 2 pigs
Player 2 accumlates total of that roll
(for player input) Player 2 can stop rolling at any time
Player 2 must stop rolling when they Pig Out or reach 100 pts

Cyle repeats until 1 player reaches 100 total points

Pig Sides:
Dot Side
Blank Side
Standing
On Back
On Snout

Possible rolls =
Pig Out = 1 dot side + 1 blank side
Sider = 1 dot side + 1 dot side
Trotter = 1 standing + any other position than standing
Double Trotter = 1 standing + 1 standing
Razor Back = 1 on back + any other position than on back
Double Razorback = 1 on back + 1 on back
Snouter = 1 on snout + 1 any other position than on snout
Double Snouter = 1 on snout + 1 on snout

Scoring:
Pig Out = -total round pts
Sider = 1 pts
Trotter = 5pts
Double Trotter = 20 pts
Razor Back = 5 pts
Double Razorback = 20 pts
Snouter = 10 pts
Double Snouter = 40 pts
Touching = -total game pts

## Notes for instructor

When we start to implement user input, I would like users to have a choice to stop rolling and keep their points instead of running the risk of Pigging Out!
